Expected Empirical Patterns for Validation
------------------------------------------
1) κ (Kappa): should increase or stabilize over time; positive correlation with ρ and φ.
2) σ (Sigma): should gradually decline as κ and ρ improve (reduced moral entropy).
3) ρ (Rho): should track κ (coherence → regularity/resilience).
4) φ (Phi): should rise modestly with κ; mild oscillations are normal in adaptive pluralism.
5) M(t): should show a smooth, upward-bright trend across years/regions (ethical stabilization).

Quick Diagnostic Thresholds (heuristic)
---------------------------------------
• If σ rises while κ rises: mis-specified proxies or missing normalization.
• If M(t) is flat/noisy: latent coupling incomplete or inputs sparse.
• If φ collapses while κ, ρ stay high: ethical monoculture or reduced adaptability.
• Coverage check: require ≥2 observed latents pre-imputation per row for trustworthy M.

Notes
-----
These expectations follow the v0.8 FEP-constrained moral-informational model. They are descriptive
guides, not pass/fail tests; use them to triage data issues and refine proxy mappings.
