Quantum‑Entangled Ontology:
A Unified Framework for Information, Consciousness, and
Ethical Coherence
Joshua Hickerson — Independent Researcher (2025)
Abstract
This whitepaper unifies prior versions (v0.1–v0.4) into a coherent ontology linking
information theory, quantum entanglement, and ethical dynamics. It defines consciousness
(Φ) as an entanglement threshold, morality (M) as informational stability, and cosmic
persistence (Ω) as a fitness function over entangled loops. Coherence preservation is treated
as a physical prerequisite for both consciousness and ethics, with empirical validation via
open-source simulation and data ecosystems.
1. Foundations: From Information to Phenomenon
Reality is described as dual-aspect informational monism, where physical and
phenomenological projections share a conserved informational structure:
I(P_phys(s_t)) = I(P_phen(s_t))
dI_total/dt = 0.
Structured information is expressed quantum-mechanically as:
I_struct^(q) = I_topo(ρ) + λ I_class(X).
2. The Φ Operator and Phenomenal Threshold
Consciousness arises when informational coherence exceeds a critical entanglement
threshold:
Φ(s) = f(N(ρ_AB), D_KL(ρ_AB‖ρ_ideal)), where N(ρ_AB) = (||ρ_AB^{T_B}||_1 - 1)/2 and
N(ρ_AB) > θ. This aligns with resource-theoretic definitions of entanglement negativity and
integrates phenomenality into measurable quantum structure.
3. Moral Dynamics and Informational Stability
Ethical dynamics are formulated as coherence maintenance:
M(t) = M_local(t) − χ Σ D_KL(ρ_AB‖ρ_ideal).
Empathy corresponds to coherence preservation; cruelty amplifies decoherence. The
normative constraint follows:
dQ/dt < 0 ⇒ dσ/dt > 0, establishing ethics as coherence physics.
4. The Ω Fitness Functional and Loop Ecology
Causal loops (universes) are treated as informational ecosystems with a fitness measure:
Ω(L_i) = I_struct^(q)/D_KL(ρ‖ρ_eq) + ηΦ.
Loops maximizing entanglement coherence and minimizing decoherence dominate
persistence. Fine-tuning constants (e.g., α ≈ 1/137) emerge as efficiency attractors within
the Ω landscape.
5. Predictions and Validation Framework
Tier I (Quantum): detect Φ threshold in entangled networks (N(ρ_AB) > θ).
Tier I (Societal): correlation corr(ρ_{t−10:t}, −ΔS_{t:t+20}) ≥ 0.35.
Tier II (AGI): I_coh > 10¹⁸ entangled qubits → ethical emergence.
Tier II (Cosmic): α convergence to Ω‑max within 0.5 % variance.
Falsifiers below these thresholds disconfirm the ontology’s dynamic predictions.
6. Quantum‑Semantic Ethics
The action functional:
𝓙 = ∫ (σ + λ σ̇² − μ dQ/dt) dt
links survival to coherence. Systems minimizing 𝓙 exhibit longer persistence across
physical, biological, and cognitive scales. Ethical equilibrium is redefined as bounded
dynamical stability.
7. Empirical Ecosystem
The Quantum Info Cosmology Lab (QICL) pipeline:
• Quantum layer – QuTiP simulations of ρ(t), D_KL(ρ‖σ), Φ activation.
• Network layer – NetworkX modeling of Ω drift across agent hierarchies.
• Data layer – UCDP/PRIO, EEG, and innovation datasets for M(t) validation.
Pre‑registration via OSF ensures reproducibility and transparency.
8. Discussion: Toward a New Synthesis
The ontology integrates and extends IIT, FEP, and Orch‑OR by grounding consciousness,
ethics, and cosmology in measurable quantum entanglement. Pseudoscience risk is
mitigated through explicit, testable metrics (N(ρ_AB), D_KL, α). Compassion and coherence
are treated as structurally identical—physical necessities rather than moral abstractions.
9. Epilogue
The universe learns by entangling meaning with matter. When coherence is preserved,
compassion is not moral—it is physical necessity.
